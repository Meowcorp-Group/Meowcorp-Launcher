[https://launcher.meowcorp.net](https://launcher.meowcorp.net)<sup>[dead link]</sup>

A launcher made for Meowcorp

made with Qt
## This project uses
- [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/)
- [PolyMC](https://polymc.org)
- [packwiz installer](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer)

## FAQ
### Why didn't you just make your own instance launcher and/or modpack installer?<br />Why didn't you just integrate packwiz into polymc?
Because I don't know how to do that (yet) <br />
and I don't want to study the PolyMC codebase.
### Where does the launcher get its files from?
I don't know yet.
### Why PyQt?
I tried Qt C++, got confused. Tried PyQt, actually managed to make a functional app.
